# TI89-Snek
A snake game for TI-89 series calculators.

### Gameplay
In the game you play as a snake (snek) desperate to eat little dots (apples) and grow bigger. But beware! If you go outside the bounds or run into yourself, it will be game over. A gameplay video to download is attached [here](./examples/Snek-Example.mp4).

### Setup
In order to play this game on your TI-89 series calculator, you must have the following things in place

 - A program named **snek** with [this](./src/snek.txt) source code
 - A program named **snekapdr** with [this](./src/snekapdr.txt) source code
 - A program named **snekdraw** with [this](./src/snekdraw.txt) source code
 - A function named **snekclde** with [this](./src/snekclde.txt) source code
 - A picture file named **snekbrd** (this is the board that the snake is on)
 - A number variable named **snekhigh** (this will record the high score)
 - A number variable named **sneknum** (this will record how many times it is played)
 - A 2 element list of numbers named **snekst** (this is the start position of the snake)

Also, for the best graphics, make sure that you have axes turned off.

### Stats
This game is written in [TI-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC), and is about 120 lines of code overall. I created it over the course of ~3 1/2 hours of work. I've been creating games on the TI-89 for about a year.
